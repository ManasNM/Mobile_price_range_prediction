# Mobile_price_range_prediction

Description:
This project aimed to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their features such as battery power, camera resolution, processor speed, and more. The dataset contains various specifications of mobile phones, and the goal was to classify them into different price ranges.

Algorithms/Techniques Used:
Logistic Regression: Used for classification as a baseline model.
Decision Trees: Provided better performance by handling non-linear relationships.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Applied for more accurate classification with kernel trick.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Used to compare performance in terms of simplicity.
Cross-validation: Implemented to ensure robustness of the model.

Conclusion:
The Support Vector Machine provided the best accuracy in predicting the mobile price range, with features such as battery power, RAM, and screen size playing critical roles in determining the price category. This model could be beneficial for manufacturers in deciding the pricing strategy based on key product features, enabling competitive pricing in the market.
